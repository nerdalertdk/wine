## Maintenance

I do not have a dedicated maintenance schedule for this image. In case a new stable version of Wine is released, I might update the image accordingly.

If you experience any problems with the image, open up an issue on the [source repository](https://github.com/nerdalertdk/wine). I'll look into it as soon as possible.

## Copyright free
